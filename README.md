# Mini_Sumo_Semi_Auto

Radio controlled code to a esp32 doit devkit, using a PS4 controller and bluetooth.
The code consists in a controller to the sumo robot with pre programmed movements to use throughout the match.
The ideia is to overcome the reflex of the opponent.

## V1

Currently the code has two moves and two control modes.
The project uses a TB6612FNG driver and a 3S battery to power the motors. 
This version of the code is not very organized because every function is on main.cpp, but it works!
